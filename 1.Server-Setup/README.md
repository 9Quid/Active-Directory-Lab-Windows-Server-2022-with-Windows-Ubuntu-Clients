# 1.Server-Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Install Windows Server 2022 on VMware.
- Configure initial server settings (hostname, NIC, IP, updates).
- Verify network connectivity and readiness for AD DS deployment.

## Steps and Walkthroughs

### Step 1 - Installed Windows Server 2022

-Firstly, I deployed windows server on VMware Workstation Pro and allocated **4 GB RAM**, **2 CPUs**, and **60 GB disk**.

Next, I installed Server 2022 Datacenter with Desktop Experience.

Then confirmed the set-up was complete.

### Step 2 - Configure Network Interface

- Set static IP: **192.168.1.9**
- Subnet mask: **255.255.255.0**
- Default Gateway: **192.168.1.1**
- Preferred DNS: **192.168.1.9**

- then confirmed configurations were applied by running ipconfig command

### Step 3 â€“ Rename Server & Join Domain Preparation

- Here, I renamed the server: 9Quid-Server

- Verified network connectivity by pinging the DNS server and the loopback address.

## Key Settings, Commands & Troubleshooting Notes

### Key Settings

- create a custom NAT if using VMware to ensure internet access after assigning a static ip address
- Rename your server and assign a static ip address before promoting it to a domain controller
- Take regular snapshots so you can easily rollback in case of system crashes or failures

## Useful Commands

### Check IP cconfiguration

- ipconfig /all

### Test DNS resolution

- ping 192.168.1.9

### Check loopback

- ping 127.0.0.1

### Restart after updates

- Restart-Computer -Force

## Troubleshooting Example

### Issue:>

- Lost internet connection after assigning a static IP on the default NAT network.

### Resolution:>
>
- I created a custom NAT network in VMware Workstation, then reconfigured the serverâ€™s NIC to use this new network. Internet access was restored while maintaining static IP addressing for the domain.

### Lessons Learned

- VMwareâ€™s Easy Install prompts for a license key â€” skip ISO selection during VM creation to avoid this.

- A snapshot-first approach prevents losing hours if AD setup fails.

- Using a custom NAT gives you control over addressing and avoids internet loss when static IPs are used.
