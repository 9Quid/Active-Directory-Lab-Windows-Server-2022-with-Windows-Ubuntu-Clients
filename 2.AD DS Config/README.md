### Step 2 Promote Server to Domain Controller

After installing AD DS, I went on to promote the server to a Domain Controller.
> **Note:** At this stage, I took a snapshot of the system to preserve its current state before promotion.

### Lessons Learned

- Snapshots are your best friend. Take regular snapshots to save rollback in case of any misconfigurations.

- DNS is tightly integrated: AD DS setup automatically installs/configures DNS, and allows promotion to be successfull.

After promotion a reboot is mandatory.

OU creation is a quick test. Creating an OU  is a simple way to confirm DC is working properly.

Patience during promotion. The wizard takes a while and can look stuck â€” but letting it finish is the way to go.
